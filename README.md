## Welcome to my GitHub page! 

My research is in articulatory and acoustic phonetics, and my work has focused on many different languages, including the Australian languages Arrernte, Pitjantjatjara, Warlpiri, Yanyuwa and Yindjibarndi; and the European languages English, French, Russian and Croatian. More recently I have also worked on languages of Africa, Asia and the Pacific - Goemai (Nigeria), Tima (Sudan), Makasar (Indonesia), Lisu (China), Kannada and Malayalam (India), Tongan (Tonga), and Qaqet and Mian (PNG). 

I am the Editor of the Journal of the International Phonetic Association, with special responsibility for the Illustrations of the International Phonetic Alphabet; and an executive member of the permanent council of the International Phonetic Association. I have previously served on the executive of the Australasian Speech Science and Technology Association, and on the Australian Research Council College of Experts. I am also a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Phonetics, and have previously served as Associate Editor for this journal.
