## Welcome to my GitHub page! 

My research is in articulatory and acoustic phonetics, and my work has focused on many different languages, including the Australian languages Arrernte, Pitjantjatjara, Warlpiri, Yanyuwa and Yindjibarndi; and the European languages English, French, Russian and Croatian. More recently I have also worked on languages of Africa, Asia and the Pacific - Goemai (Nigeria), Tima (Sudan), Makasar (Indonesia), Lisu (China), Kannada and Malayalam (India), Tongan (Tonga), and Qaqet and Mian (PNG). 

I am the Editor of the [*Journal of the International Phonetic Association (JIPA)*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-international-phonetic-association), with special responsibility for the Illustrations of the International Phonetic Alphabet; and an executive member of the permanent council of the [International Phonetic Association](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/). I have previously served on the executive of the [Australasian Speech Science and Technology Association](https://assta.org), and on the Australian Research Council College of Experts. I was previously an associate editor for the [*Journal of Phonetics*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-phonetics). 

Here is our map showing the [Illustrations of the IPA](https://richardbeare.github.io/marijatabain/ipa_illustrations_all.html), which are published in *JIPA* 

And here is a [link](https://assta.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/No_01_Tabain_Garellek_et_al_2024_1_6.pdf) to my recent conference paper with Marc Garellek and Matthew Gordon, discussing issues with the IPA consonant chart, with some suggested changes proposed. I'll post an update  soon - there was a lot of discussion after the talk!
